        Joseph Benjamin Lawton began his printing
        journey in the late 1800s at age 10. Years
        later after being shot for printing the truth in
        his Louisiana newspaper, he decided to apply
        his courage to a new venture in Orlando -
        pineapple farming. The severe freeze of 1899
        forced J.B. Lawton to return to what he knew
        —printing. Lawton Press was formed in 1900,
        and our family’s legacy began`,
        `The Lawton family tradition continued, with each
        son learning printing from a young age, expanding
        the business with each generation. J.C. Lawton
        took over until 1948, followed by J.B. Lawton III,
        and then Ces Lawton in 1981. In 2002, the 5th
        generation, Kimberly Lawton Koon, and Tyler Koon
        took over the helm driving growth with advanced
        technology.`,
